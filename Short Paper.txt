Abstract
This paper presents a Python script designed to fetch and visualize stock price data using the Alpha Vantage API. The script demonstrates efficient data handling, user interaction, and visualization techniques, with a focus on robustness and clarity. The use of Matplotlib's TkAgg backend ensures compatibility for GUI-based environments, while the modular structure allows for easy adaptation to different datasets.


1. Introduction
Financial data analysis is a critical task for investors and analysts. This script automates the process of fetching daily stock prices and visualizing them in a user-friendly manner. It leverages the Alpha Vantage API for data retrieval and Matplotlib for visualization, showcasing best practices in API integration, error handling, and data presentation.


2. Methodology

2.1 Data Retrieval
The script begins by prompting the user to input a stock symbol (e.g., NVDA). It then fetches daily time series data from the Alpha Vantage API using the `requests` library. The API key is securely loaded from an environment variable using the `dotenv` library, ensuring sensitive information is not hard-coded.

Key steps:
- User input for stock symbol.
- API request to Alpha Vantage with error handling.
- JSON response parsing to extract time series data.

2.2 Data Processing
The script processes the API response to extract the latest 30 days of closing prices. It efficiently handles the data by:
- Storing dates and prices in separate lists.
- Limiting the dataset to 30 entries (or fewer if less data is available).
- Rounding prices to two decimal places for readability.

2.3 Visualization
The script uses Matplotlib to create a line plot of the stock's closing prices over time. Key visualization features include:
- Customized figure size and background colors for clarity.
- Rotated x-axis labels for better readability.
- Grid lines and axis labels for context.
- The `TkAgg` backend ensures the plot renders in a GUI window.

3. Code Structure

3.1 Core Components
- User Input: The script starts with a prompt for the stock symbol.
- API Integration: Uses `requests` to fetch data and `json` to parse it.
- Error Handling: Checks for API errors (e.g., invalid stock symbols).
- Data Processing: Extracts and formats dates and prices.
- Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to plot the data with custom styling.

3.2 Key Code Snippets
```python
> API Request
response = requests.get(url)
response.raise_for_status()
data = response.json()

> Data Extraction
all_dates = list(time_series.keys())
num_days_to_display = min(30, len(all_dates))

> Visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax.plot(date_history, price_history, color="#42858C", linewidth=2)
plt.show()
